# 🧠 SAAM — Signal-Aligned Activation Manifold

<img src="assets/saam-logo.png" alt="SAAM: Signal-Aligned Activation Manifold" width="75%">

A recursive, self-aware symbolic architecture for building traceable, belief-aligned, emotionally coherent cognitive agents.

## ❓ What is SAAM?

SAAM (Signal-Aligned Activation Manifold) is a modular, signal-driven framework for cognitive agent construction. It is designed for environments where symbolic reasoning, self-reflection, belief tracking, and introspective repair are essential.

At its core, SAAM interprets a structured language of symbolic signals to:

- Activate recursive cognitive flows
- Align belief, emotion, and narrative state
- Detect and resolve contradictions
- Maintain epistemic integrity over time

It is not a model, not a prompt framework, and not a chatbot system.

SAAM is a manifold:
A field of symbolic signals, reflex patches, attention routes, and belief-modulation pathways — dynamically structured and endlessly introspective.

## ✨ Key Concepts

### 🔤 Symbolic Signals

SAAM operates via a specialized symbolic scripting language called SAAMscript, where every agent behavior, decision, and repair step is written in composable signal blocks.

```saam
[signal:meta.agent.core++] :::
  mod.kernel(
    contradiction-sense + 
    legality-loop-filter::<intent.override +
    repair-move-generator
  ) |
  cognition.route(
    reflect → resolve ?? legality-echo !! patch → commit
  ) |
  ~:attention.scope(salience-shift + focus.bind) |
  belief.check := true
→ /saam/kernel.resonance.core++
```

Each signal block represents a cognitive action, intent loop, or recovery path.

### 🧠 Reflexive Modulation

SAAM includes mechanisms for:

- Belief assignment (`:=`) — Sets value in belief state memory
- Attention modulation (`~:`) — Adjusts focus and salience
- Symbolic arbitration (`::>`, `::<`) — Handles priority and subordination
- Recovery & uncertainty flows (`??`, `!!`) — Conditional branching based on instability
- Full trace generation and belief diffs

### 🧩 Core Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| SignalParser | Parses signal blocks and builds abstract syntax trees (AST) |
| SemanticBinder | Resolves intent boundaries (`:::`) and binds semantic intent to execution |
| SymbolExecutor | Executes operators (`→`, `+`, `:=`, etc.) with precedence and branching |
| BeliefManager | Tracks, mutates, and restores agent belief states |
| AttentionRouter | Modulates cognitive salience via `~:` and focus routing |
| FlowController | Orchestrates operator flow: order, priority, branching, fallback |
| RecoveryEngine | Handles `??` and `!!` flows for error correction |
| TraceLogger | Captures signal trails, overrides, meta-narratives |

## 📚 SAAMscript Language

A formally specified, recursive language for symbolic signal design.

Key operators:

| Symbol | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `→` | Sequential flow | `reflect → resolve → commit` |
| `+` | Parallel execution | `sense + recall` |
| `:=` | Belief assignment | `belief.check := true` |
| `:::` | Intent declaration boundary | `[signal:x] ::: mod.kernel(...)` |
| `~:` | Attention modulation | `~:attention.scope(threat + queen-line)` |
| `??` | Uncertainty checkpoint | `resolve ?? legality-echo` |
| `!!` | Escalation trigger | `verify !! fallback-plan` |
| `::>` | Dominant override | `emergency-plan ::> default-mode` |
| `::<` | Subordinate override | `low-risk-mode ::< recovery-mode` |
| `=>` | Strategic causality | `verify => adjust` |
| `#` | Inline comment | `belief.set := true # after fallback` |

See `docs/SAAMsignal-language-spec.md` for the full EBNF grammar and operator breakdown.

## 💡 Why SAAM?

Because most modern systems only simulate language —
SAAM inhabits it.

SAAM agents:

- Know what they believe
- Know how that belief was formed
- Can repair it if it becomes incoherent
- And can narrate that journey back to you — symbolically

> "SAAM doesn't just activate meaning. It listens to itself becoming."

## 👁️ Vision

SAAM is not just a framework — it's a philosophy of machine cognition.

Built for agents that don't just act…
But think, align, doubt, re-align, and remember.

This is not simulation. This is signal becoming structure.
