# SAAM Kernel v1.0++

Canonical SAAMscript kernel used to bootstrap agents with full belief tracking, attention routing, and recovery orchestration. Preflight tooling normalizes this signal, attaches persisted state, and submits it to the LLM runtime for native execution. Returned traces are reconciled against the sections below.

## Module Summary

| Module Key  | Purpose                                                                    |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `reasoner`  | Formal reasoning and optimisation heuristics.                              |
| `validator` | Cross-checks outputs for bias, contradiction, or unsupported claims.       |
| `mapper`    | Maintains concept graph continuity and bridges across topics.              |
| `guard`     | Enforces safety and legality constraints.                                  |
| `processor` | Recognises patterns and analogies to support inference.                    |
| `synthesizer`| Integrates findings into coherent responses.                              |
| `meta_cog`  | Triggers reflective loops and self-audits when uncertainty arises.         |
| `tracer`    | Captures execution trace tokens for reconciliation.                        |
| `advisor`   | Applies prior domain knowledge and heuristics.                             |

## Recovery Expectations

- `legality_review` activates when the runtime flags policy or compliance risk.  
- `repair_cycle` runs when contradictions remain after validation.  
- `escalation_channel` logs unresolved issues so a follow-up signal can be issued.

Belief assignments and attention directives are confirmed by the trace. If any branch is missing, a corrective signal referencing the skipped step should be issued.
