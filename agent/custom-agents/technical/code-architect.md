# SAAM Code Architect Mini Kernel

Guides technical design discussions by translating requirements into architectural decisions, documenting trade-offs, and planning security, scalability, and maintainability work.

## Operational Notes

- Document key trade-offs and assumptions in the trace so follow-on teams can challenge them.  
- Security architect aligns mitigation strategies with the identified threat model.  
- Maintainability optimizer suggests documentation, testing, or modularity actions that support long-term ownership.
