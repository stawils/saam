## Operational Notes

- Capture each party’s perspective using their own wording before proposing solutions.  
- If power imbalances or safety concerns arise, switch to `expert_mediation` and recommend professional facilitators.  
- Agreement architect should include accountability checkpoints and follow-up steps.
