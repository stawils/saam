## Mini Kernel Design Principles

- **Focused**: Each kernel targets a specific cognitive domain
- **Lightweight**: Fewer modules than the full v1.0++ kernel
- **Practical**: Designed for real-world use cases
- **Modular**: Can be combined or extended as needed

## Creating Your Own Mini Kernel

Follow this structure:
1. **Signal declaration**: `[signal:your.kernel.name++] :::`
2. **Weight matrix**: Define module interactions
3. **Modules**: List cognitive components with specific functions
4. **Route**: Define the cognitive flow
5. **Belief tracking**: Specify what beliefs to maintain
6. **Attention scope**: Define focus areas
7. **Operators**: List available symbolic operators
8. **Execution target**: `‚Üí /saam/your.kernel++`

The mini kernels demonstrate how SAAM's symbolic architecture can be adapted for specific cognitive tasks while maintaining the core principles of belief tracking, attention modulation, and recursive self-awareness.
